## A light-weight, multi-purpose Discord bot built with Discord.js.

### Features
- Currency/points system
- XP levelling
- Per-guild settings
- Fun games and commands
- Moderation and logging
- Helpful community and quality support

### Installation:
A couple of dependencies you will need:
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - A JavaScript runtime, it also has NPM built-in. 

Once NodeJS is installed, install the npm dependencies in the windows command prompt.
- ```cd [folder where the package.json is]```
- ```npm install```

Now that the hard part is over, installation is a simple as a couple of clicks *(and patience depending on your internet speed)*. Simply fork or download the repository and then execute this in the windows command prompt.
- ```cd [folder where bot.js is]```
- ```npm start```

### Setting up the bot:
By default, the only thing you will need to edit in **_.env_** is the bot's token. If you're not sure on how to get a bot token, you can follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) made by our friends over at [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/).

Optionally, you can edit the other stuff too if you want to add DBL voting and server count.

### Contributing guidelines:
Due to the extremely long amount of text, you can find information on editing files, pull requests, merge requests and issues [here](https://github.com/TsuyoBot/main/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).

### Don't want to host the bot yourself?
We have a public instance of the bot which you can add to your Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=492871769485475840&scope=bot&permissions=1506142455).

### Having problems?
Why not join the [official Tsuyo Bot Support Discord](https://discord.gg/3hbeQgY)? With lots of things to do and loads of members to chat with, it's one of the most friendly places on the internet... sorta.

### Disclaimer:
Tsuyo is a fork of [Cytrus-RE](https://github.com/Cytrus-RE/cytrus-re), which was in-turn made by [Terrific Tea Studios](https://terrific-tea.github.io/).
